============================
Shared Libraries Location
============================

The directory structure of a Shared Library is very specific. It should contain: src, vars and resources directories.

In our repo, the shared libraries are defined at:

MonoRepo-X/Core-Services/Jenkins/JenkinsSharedLibrary
├── resources
│   └── lint.sh
└── vars
    ├── continuousIntegrationMain.groovy
    └── continuousIntegrationPR.groovy

"src" directory
    - contains the static classes where it can be used as a helper class for other pipelines. 
      Generally it contains a very common data which can be used across pipelines.

"vars" directory
    - this directory hosts script files that are exposed as a variable in Pipelines.
    - The name of the file is the name of the variable in the Pipeline

"resources" directory
    - If your shared library needs additional resources such as configuration files, templates, 
      or any non-Groovy assets, you can place them in the resources directory.


====================================
Shared Libraries Setup in Console
====================================

Jenkins-Console >> Manage Jenkins >> System

Configure a new library under "Global Pipeline Libraries" as follows:
Name : my-shared-library
Default Version: <Name of the branch> ("main" or "New-CI-WorkFlow" (name of the branch you are working on) )
Select:
    - Allow default version to be overridden
    - include @Library changes in job recent changes
Retrieval method:
    - Modern SCM
        - Git
        - Project Repo: https://github.com/vjkancherla/Monorepo-X
    - Behaviors
        - Discover branches
Library Path: Core-Services/Jenkins/JenkinsSharedLibrary/


===================================
Shared Library and GitHub Branch
====================================

The best practise is to, once we have stable shared library code base
1. create a new branch off of main. Name the branch: jenkins-shared-libraries-20230923

2. Re-run the previous section - "Shared Libraries Setup in Console" - and use "jenkins-shared-libraries-20230923" for "Default Version"
    
-----

If you need to update shared library code base, follow these steps:
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make chages to shared library code base.
3. To test the changes, 
    - Run the previous section - "Shared Libraries Setup in Console" - and create a NEW shared library
    - use "<feature-branch-name>" for "Default Version"
    - update JenkinsFile.CI to use the new/temp shared library

[OR]
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make chages to shared library code base.
3. Push branch to remote
4. In JenkinsFile.CI, add library ("my-shared-library@<BRANCH_NAME>") as the fist line

Once testing is completed and changes have been integrated with Main branch:
1. create a new branch off of main. Name the branch: jenkins-shared-libraries-<today's date>
2. Re-run the previous section - "Shared Libraries Setup in Console" - and use "jenkins-shared-libraries-<today's date>" for "Default Version"



=========================
Invoking Shared Library
==========================

In JenkinsFile.CI, add as the first line:

    - @Library('my-shared-library') : to use the default version of shared library as defined in the Jenkins console
    - or, @Library('my-shared-library@New-CI-WorkFlow) _ : to override the default version and use branch "New-CI-WorkFlow" as our version

Invoke a Shared Library by writing in the JenkisFile.CI
    - continuousIntegrationMain()
    - continuousIntegrationPR()
