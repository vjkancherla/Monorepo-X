<< GOAL >>
When a pipeline is triggered, Jenkins should:
1. detect Microservice(s) has changed
2. invoke the pre/post-merge jenkinsfile for that Microservice


<< SETUP >>
1. Create a new multibranch Pre-Merge Pipeline

- Follow instruction from here, but make below changes: https://devopscube.com/jenkins-multibranch-pipeline-tutorial/
- For Step-6 [Behaviours], we are only interested in "Discover Pull requests from origin"
  - select Stragety: " The current pull request revision"
    we are only interested in PRs.

- For Step-7 [Mode], by jenkisfile, use script - Jenkinsfile
